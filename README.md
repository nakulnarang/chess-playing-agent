To run the project, upload both notebooks to google colab and run using the gpu for faster execution. 
After all the cells in the notebooks are executed, the model files(.pth) will be saved in the colab directory.
If you wish to run the evaluate_chess_models.py, download the model files in put in a directory called model which should have 2 directopries dqn and imitation_learning. In those directories paste the respective model files. 
Then run the evaluate_chess_models.py file. The requirement.txt file should be enough to create a virtual env to run this file.
